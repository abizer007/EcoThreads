## üé® User Interface Design Principles

EcoThreads follows the **three golden rules** of user interface design to create a user-friendly experience:

1. **Place the User in Control**  
   The platform features **clear navigation** with options like "Sell, List, or Donate Clothes," giving users full control over their actions. 

2. **Reduce the User‚Äôs Memory Load**  
   With a simple, clean design and intuitive filtering options, users don't need to remember complex steps‚Äîeverything is easily accessible.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Software Engineering Concepts Applied

In this project, we‚Äôve implemented various **Software Engineering** principles to ensure a robust, maintainable, and scalable system.

### **1. Requirements Engineering**
- **Functional Requirements**:
  - Users must be able to browse, buy, sell, and donate items.
  - Secure payment integration and review systems are required.

- **Non-Functional Requirements**:
  - The system should ensure high availability with minimal downtime.
  - It must support responsive design, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile.

### **2. Design Patterns**
- We applied **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** design pattern to separate concerns within the app:
  - **Model**: Data management (products, users, transactions).
  - **View**: User interface elements (buttons, images, forms).
  - **Controller**: Logic that handles user input and updates the model and view.

### **3. User-Centered Design**
- **User Analysis**: We identified key users (buyers, sellers, admins) and their needs to create an intuitive interface.
- **Task Analysis**: For each user group, we defined tasks such as browsing items, making payments, and listing products.

### **4. Interface Consistency**
- The user interface follows consistent design principles with a simple layout and easy-to-navigate buttons, reducing cognitive load for users.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- **Improved Filtering**: Enhanced product search and filter functionality will help users find exactly what they need faster.
- **Extended Payment Options**: Adding more payment methods to cater to a broader audience.
